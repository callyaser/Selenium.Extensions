# Selenium.Extensions
This repo contains several C# extension methods written for the IWebdriver, IWebElement types existing in the Selenium WebDriver framework. This makes interactions with the UI elements straightforward and simple.

For eg. The Selenium framework has built-in functionality to take screenshots during test execution and with extension methods we could wrap all the code/actions into a helper method and add it to an existing type/interface, IWebDriver and this lets us capture screenshots, save it to file storage in a straightforward, shorter syntax.
