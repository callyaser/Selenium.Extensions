# Selenium.Extensions
This repo contains several C# extension methods written for the IWebdriver, IWebElement types existing in the Selenium WebDriver framework. This makes interactions with the UI elements straightforward and simple.

For eg. The Selenium framework can take screenshots but with extension methods we could wrap all the code/actions into a helper method and add it to an existing type/class. This way we can capture screenshots during test execution in a straightforward manner with a nicer and shorter syntax.
